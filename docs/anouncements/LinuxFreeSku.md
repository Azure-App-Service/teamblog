Free Tier for App Service on Linux
=============

Experimentation and exploration are how curious developers try out cloud-based development. With the new Free Tier, developers can easily experiment using App Service on Linux without ever worrying about paying a bill. Using the Free Tier is as easy as selecting the Free SKU when initially creating a new web application.

## Limitations 

Each Azure Subscription can create a single free tier app service plan. Within that app service plan you may create as many sites as you want, only limited by the resource constraints of the underlying infrastructure. 

## Quotas

Linux Free Tier App Service Plans are subject to the following daily quotas/limitations:

- 60 minutes of CPU Time 
- 1 GB Memory Usage
- 180 MB of Data Out
- No WebSocket connections to the app

If your App Service Plan exceeds these quotas, for all apps in the plan you will see an HTTP Status Code 429 indicating your app is stopped.
